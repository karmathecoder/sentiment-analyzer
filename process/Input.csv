LC AC,"Summers are sometimes challenging to manage, and the warmth is beyond the capacity of desert coolers.

Powerful cooling even with normal mode. I'm using it for 250 sqft hall, with doors to 3 rooms.2. It has four normal modes where AC runs at 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% capacity to reach the same temperature, and can be used in conjunction with the density of crows and heat generating systems inside the room3. There's a high capacity mode (6 in 1_H'Capa button on remote) which runs at 110% capacity and extra speed of indoor unit for faster cooling (runs only for 90 mins). This setting has a dedicated button on the remote.4. Then, we have an AI mode that senses the load and runs at optimal capacity. (6 in 1_AC+4 button on remote)5. Fins on both units have what they call ocean black coating to enhance the life of the fins by providing protection against external elements6. Indoor unit sound is on the lower side. The outdoor unit is a bit loud, but it's an outdoor one.7. Large display which you can switch off (especially at night)8. You may use it simply to create an airflow inside the room without a cooling effect9. It has a dehumidifier mode to reduce humidity inside simply10. Since this one is an ISEER 5 star device (818 units per year under test conditions), it consumes fairly less electricity, but don't expect wonders11. It has a hidden power on/off button located below the horizontal vane, on the right side, for use in case of emergencies12. Sleep mode is a nice option, as at a set temperature, you tend to start feeling cold after some time, and this mode increases temperature by 2 degrees over the next hour.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚ûñ OBSERVATIONS & CONS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢The only cons are in the remote and not the unit:1.

(excludes 3-pin top and drain pipe, which I didn't purchase from the engineer)They charge extra for a set of interconnection pipes between the indoor and outdoor unit (two copper pipes for inlet and return) if the supplied 3-meter set is insufficient. But if carefully planned, you won't need it.Other points to note:1. It comes with a leaflet having installation instructions along with a user manual. Please GO through it and ask them to follow the guidelines, such as the indoor unit is installed at a slight inclination rather than being completely horizontal for smooth flow of water that collects on the tray over time of operation2. Leakages are to be checked using soap water at all the joints3. Power supply and all also need to be checked, and generally, this step is skipped4. When the engineer calls before visiting, ask them to bring a core drill to avoid using a hammer and chisel, which damages the wall, and the hole is also not uniform.5. Carefully plan the position of the hole on the wall so that the wire, drain pipe, and copper pipes can directly go to the opposite side of the wall and can be hidden behind the unit.6. The hole should not be straight but have an inclination of a few degrees toward the outside.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üîÅ FEATURES‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. All of the features are accessible via remote, and the main unit has only one button to switch the unit on/off, and that too is buried deep inside2. Comfort air mode toggles between the top and bottom positions of the horizontal flap. So, if suddenly you need to turn the airflow toward the ceiling away from you, this is the button. Handy at times and reduces the necessity of using the swing button to toggle through all swing positions3. Dedicated light off button to switch on/off main units display4. Mode to toggle between cool, dry, and dehumidification modes5. 6 in 1 H'Capa and 6 in 1 AC + 4, to switch between 4 capacities (100%, 80%, 60%, 40%), AI mode, and High capacity mode6. Horizontal and vertical swings can be combined for many positions to direct air anywhere in the room. It can be towards the top right corner, bottom left corner, center, left or right half of the room, etc.7. Room temperature tells the current room temperature via a sensor installed in the remote. (so it's like the remote's temperature, which should be the same as room temperature )8. Sleep button - sleep function is an exciting bit where you can set 1 hour to 7 hours timer, and additionally system increases the temperature in increments of 1 every 30 mins (two times in any cycle) for comfortable sleep9. Timer button to set on/off time10. Function button is pretty useless here since it has no additional functionality‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üèÜ FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢The device has many useful features and perfectly does the one job it is made for - efficient cooling.You may got for the version with WiFi connectivity for 1k or 2k more to control AC via internet and one of the use cases could be to pre start it before reaching home to have comforting room environment. But personally I feel it a bit gimmicky, for e.g. my washing machine has that feature and I seldom use it."
LC AC,Good quality AC from LG - lives upto it‚Äôs standard. Lower price or better energy efficiency would have made a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
LC AC,Very nice
LC AC,"Product quality is good but after sales support from LG local services center are grossly disappointing, don't misread into the installation charges. You will be in for a surprise with discrepancies on installation charges. Please ensure you check with LG installation service team before hand."
LC AC,Worst installation service charged 3000 for 3 meters copper pipe and took extra money for connecting to stabiliser

LC AC,"This is a review after only a week of installation. Will update the review after prolonged usage.DeliveryThe Amazon delivery is hassle free as ussual. AC was delivered within promised date. A point to note here is that Amazon does not provide the stand for external unit. It has to be procured through service personnel at additional cost. Overall delivery experience 5/5.InstallationThe installation ticket was raised by Amazon as soon as the AC was delivered. LG customer care contacted me the same day and arranged installation for the very next day. The technicians were clueful and courteous. The only hiccup I faced was with making a hole for pipelines and power cable for outer unit from inner unit. Since the wall was thick and considerably wet on the outside due to ongoing rains, a procedure called core cutting was resorted to. This work is not done by the LG technicians but they were helpful enough to suggest a local guy for the same. The cost was told upfront and no I faced no issues with the work done. The installation process continued and was completed the same day with no further problems. The installation is chargeable and not included in the order.  Overall 4/5.PerformanceThe performance of the AC is exemplary. There are multiple modes in the AC for different power saving setups depending on the environmental conditions and people inside the room. These can be selected manually or through automated AI mode. The AI mode (dislayed as AC on the unit) is where this AC truly shines. It automatically senses the conditions and sets the compressor and fan speed to optimum levels. During the use of this mode, the AC was able to maintain comfortable and optimum temperature throughout the night without any intervention from us. I was more than happy to see it's performance after a good night's sleep. The AC also has a High Cool function for those cruel summer afternoons where the performance is ramped up above it's nominal limits but for a limit amount of time (90 mins). This is for quickly cooling the room during hot days. There are other features like silent mode, ionisation mode etc which can be accessed through function button kn the remote. The remote does not come with a backlight or night glow buttons but that didn't cause a problem as the AI mode was competent enough to keep me comfortable without any intervention from my side. Overall the performance is 5/5."
LC AC,"Excellent quality, fast cool mode, economy mode."
LC AC,Awesome ProductDelivery on TimeInstallation Done on time by LG technician
LC AC,The installation charges are 3k and not 1199 mentioned
LC AC,"Noisy at full speed fan mode, but quiet enough at medium to low fan speed.Cooling is good and features are more than enough for normal use. Room temperature display is useful. Remote is good enough.Overall, no complains."
LC AC,Everything is good and fine. I love it.
LC AC,Fine
LC AC,Nothing
LC AC,Good
LC AC,Product is good. Take care of service. Don't change gas without thinking gas will come for more than 5 years. Also service provided by lg 3rd party is not good. so get the work done completely when ordering a service.
LC AC,good
LC AC,"Have been using this AC for a week now. It's very efficient. Cools down the room fairly quick. Very quite for a 1.5 tonne AC.  Lots of features. Amazon did a great job delivering the product on time. LG's technician came to install on the same day. They did a very thorough job with the installation. One thing I found rather weird is, they charge for everything. Installation charges  are informed prior to the purchase. But paying extra for the outdoor unit stand is not expected ( I think it should be included with the purchase of AC), that too for a reputated brand like LG. And additional charges for cotton tape etc. I paid 2200 for installation, stand and other things."

LC AC,"Super colling,like it"
LC AC,"Hi. AC was installed yesterday and is working fine. Cooling is very good and no noise. The installation cost, especially copper pipe is too expensive. They charged me Rs. 1000 per meter for copper pipe. AC copper pipe is  available on Amazon at Rs. 200 per meter and copper pipe insulation foam is a available on Amazon for Rs. 100 per meter. So total cost on Amazon is Rs. 300 per meter. Just way too expensive pricing by installation team for copper pipe. They charged me Rs. 4500 for 4.5 meter pipe and Rs. 7046 overall for installation. Don't know if this is standard rate of copper pipe from LG or if the local installer is overcharging. Please source copper pipe locally or on Amazon instead of buying from installation team. They also put some white tape on the insulatiom foam, and charged Rs. 440 for it, which is not needed. Save your money. Hope this helps."
LC AC,"LG air condition are little bit higher rate wise, but the quality and technology are best in this segment.Don;t go for cheaper price offered by other companies. Buy one time LG air condition and live tension free.RC"
LC AC,
LC AC,Putting this review After usage of more than 2 months. Overall ac performance is nice specially noise level is amazingly low.It does it job decentlySome of the features which are missed after being so high on price:1.  no temperature control when ac is run on moisture mode.2. Since it is convertible and and has AI mode also it becomes confusing to operate.3. Remote control unit does not have screen backlight display which is a big miss.4. AI mode should be customisable as per users requirementsOverall four stars for this ac.Installation and pipe charges are extra which may cost around 2100/-.
LC AC,Excellent product
LC AC,Good
LC AC,Wonderful gift to my brother who loves more in his room which cools faster... Value for money and wonderful modes that makes all in family to have nice sleep.
LC AC,All in one of the most amazing products and very useful purchase of my life
LC AC,This is one of the best ACs available Currently. I have bought this twice.Installation service was seamless. Cooling is great.Highly recommended.
LC AC,"First of all .I ordered a 2022 model but amazon gave me a 2021 model.But as it was mentioned as dec 2021 I didn't want to return it.This is not fair trade practice and Amazon has to compensate for this.The ac installation was done next day and it was smooth.they bill for 1415 and charge u extra for all extras used.They don't give bill for those extras .Also they tempt u to go for extended warranty and amc for next 4 years which I took.As for the pros and cons are concerned.the pros of the ac is good cooling,noise level fine,swing action of fin u have to use repeatedly to understand the same.Cons.the dust filter is on the top unlike ususal acs where u find it once u open the indoor.So the chances of dust filter getting dirty as it's directly exposed is very high and I was told by the lg technician to clean it every week without fail.It does not have wifi so u can't connect to lg thin.As far as the power consumption is concerned let me feedback after 2 months.Overall ok but not wah."
LC AC,"I searched for Blue star but i didn't found it due to confused customer rating. I visited a local dealer, he suggested few models in Bluestar & LG. but this model not avail in the local market, after read the specification LG website i feel this one good at it level. I am happy with product including installation."
LC AC,Awesome cooling if your room is medium size it's perfect for you.Different modes are given.One thing for sure you hv to change bucket again and again because it produces lots of water. Well it depends on humidity i guess.Otherwise nothing wrong.Value for money product.
LC AC,Very good performance
LC AC,AC is fine with good cooling however installation is very costly and a bad experience. They charge you for water drain pipe which is 150 per mtr and even for the socket. LG needs to look into this and provide these basic items . The service centre has not even given any bill yet.
LC AC,Nice
LC AC,"This is a really good product. I have seen many people complaining about missing copper pipe and awful installation. But my delivery is very clean and even though the installation guys came a week after the product delivery, they did a really good job and are very friendly. Charged me just the standard installation charges, and nothing more. Even at 40% capacity at 24¬∞C, it's really cooling well. Terrific purchase. Definitely buying another one for my other bedroom."
LC AC,"Installation date: 15th april_22 1st Review date:  16th april_22Amazon delivery- I never get cheated by Amazon. It was supposed to deliver by 16th april but it delivered early by 14th april and installation done by very next day. ü§ó THANK YOU AMAZONPackaging: Excellent packaging done also the delivery person was too careful. After delivery he checked with me if there is any dent.In the box - 1 IDU, 1ODU,1 Remote, 2 Battery, pipes (10fit), all other fitting accessory. (No items missing)Noise level- Truly Impressive. Never seen such low noise. Very comfortable. Even out door unit also sounds very low.Cooling - chilli the room within 10mints. In 60% capacity.At 20¬∞CMy Room - 12'-12' , ground floor, direct sunlight.Stabilizer - If your area have frequent voltage fluctuation then go for candus 4KVA stabilizer(90v to 280v) for 1.5 ton ac.. voltage fluctuations will effect cooling power also.Installation- Don't get any impression from negetive comments for installation. It depends like how efficient technician in your area. As like my area's technician was very efficient the know there job & i don't have to say anything.Installation charge- 1415/- ( all inclusive)Out door stand- 750/- ( all inclusive)Waterproof tape on connecting wire- 300/-Total - 2465/-Remote- Lot of options available, only a light required in it. It's very much problematic in night.Electricity consumption will provide later, and will come to pros and cons also. ..Thank you LG üíûThank you Amazonüíû"
LC AC,Product is good. Poor packing of indoor unit. Service centre and nstallation team was not experienced.
LC AC,Exlent
LC AC,Good cooling
LC AC,"Product is working good and doing perfect cooling.Installation was done on time, the next day of product delivery. Total install cost 2415 Rs. (including stand for outer unit).Note: Whenever  getting a this installed make sure to get the indoor unit and copper pipes getting vaccumed before getting the AC gas turned on from outer unit, generally installation team skip this step as it takes time."
LC AC,Very good quality
LC AC,"One of the 3 AC's was defective. Had to be returned. The process took too many phone calls to start. Had to call several times to get the substitution completed. The going back and forth could have been avoided. Also some parts, like some copper wiring,  were missing and we had to shell out extra Rs. 3000 + to ensure the system is installed correctly. Will request reimbursement for that amount."
LC AC,Great
LC AC,"Delivered in 2 days, Good all round performance, giving 4 ratings because of not receiving 3 M copper pipe. I raised a complaint and amazon refunded for partial delivery."
LC AC,"Under 46,000/- this is easily the best 1.5 ton split AC you can buy.I have owned , over the past 15 years , ACs from Carrier , Voltas , Sharp , Daikin.This dual inverter 5star AC is easily the best in terms of price to performance ratio.It has horizontal swing in addition to the normal vertical swing.It has a capacitive loading feature by which you can run the AC at 80%, 60% or 40% load.It even has a feature to show kilowatt hours.The air filter can just be lifted up and cleaned without going to the hassle of opening the indoor unit.Some reviewers complained that they did not receive the copper gas pipe. My unit had the copper pipe.Nothing to complain of , really, unless it develops some fault in the future (which nobody can predict )."
LC AC,"I required an AC for around 200sq. ft room where direct sunlight only falls in the morning till 10'o clock. Middle floor. My use case was for daily usage of around 14 hrs mixing my work hours and sleep hours at 27-28¬∞C for ambient comfort (Shimla not desired). In current season, using it in monsoon mode mostly mixing it with occasional cool mode for the right ambient balance. I have seen the the usage going as low as 290W. So for my use case, it is working perfectly. will suggest the same model with wifi, remote would not be required at all then and UI of app is also good & functional. One of my worries was missing components from the packaging like copper pipes as many have reviewed and complained before. But nothing was missing in my case. Fixing the indoor unit, Outdoor stand setup, Connecting with stabilizer and a drill hole during cost me ‚Çπ1700. 1500 was fixed installation charges about which I was informed beforehand and 200 for outdoor stand fixing as per the described charges. Installation was done same day of delivery. So all in all happy with the product currently."
LC AC,"Installation cost around 2200 , 1415 + 750 for stand. Cooling like beast. Long time review don't know. But if you care your AC it will care for you."
LC AC,"I got new 2022 model 1.5 ton machine. It's been 3 months I'm using it in summer time e.g April to now July.Noise level is excellent but in HC mode you'll get loud noise because of high speed fan.Features are same like other LG model. Only it has 6 cooling mode that is extra for this model.Now come to the main part- ELECTRIC BILLLast year electricity bill for summer was rs.3800 something. And this year after using this ac i got electricity bill rs.4041. I do use it every day for 5 to 6 hours.I don't know if it's nightmare or not üòÉBut will see next bill for reconfirmation.I'm very impressed about it.I guess you should go for it without any hesitation.And last thing is installation charges was 3000 including outdoor stand, 20ft water pipe. It's bit expensive but technician boy was polite and good behaviour.Hope this words will help you to decide.Thanks"
LC AC,We are living in rural area where electricity voltage fluctuates and power cuts. I have chosen LG and also referred 2-3 of my relatives to go for it! Works so well! Eco mode cooling is great feature very less electricity bill! This purchase is also for one of my relative!
LC AC,"ac works fine,make sure you get it installed properly,get the installation knowledge before the installation team arrives,so you can guide them properly before installing the product"
LC AC,"This ac from lg is worth spending a few thousand rupees extra than the ones without 5 in one features , i have been using this for the past 8 months almost on a daily basis except during the winter months of december and jan , my average daily usage will be around 8 hours and maxxed at 20 hours during summer .No problem regarding the working or cooling , works like a charm cools really fast and most importantly the outdoor unit is really silent even on turbo mode .40% energy efficiency mode ; I would recommend everyone to use this mode even if there are upto four people in the room consumes only 400 watts which is the major reason for energy savings . The amount of energy saved will directly be visible on your first month of use itself and be happy about your but .Pro tip go for the wifi/ connected model as it gives you further ease of use and control over it like pre cooling the room even if you are out and setting timer at night montoring energy usage , diagnostics etc .."
LC AC,Good

LC AC,"Very good purchasing experience from Amazon. From order to till installation everything carried out smoothly. Happy with product, it‚Äôs working as per expectations. Though how energy efficient it is yet to be checked in long running summer days."
LC AC,"As with most of the recent buyers, copper wire was missing inside the box. I called the Amazon customer care and they handled it very smoothly, refunded me the full cost I had to pay LG team for missing part.This PS Q19YNZE model is available at amazon at the cheapest price compared to offline stores. Delivery and installation were very smooth and before time in Delhi city.This Ac features like convertible modes are quite user friendly and really very energy efficient. Cools my 13x12 ft room in 10 mins, without any noise.Cons : The ocean black coating which is very beneficial for Delhi/Noida region, is only in the outdoor unit and not in the indoor unit for all 2022 onwards model unlike 2020 model.After 1 month daily usage, I found :Cooling Performance : OptimumAverage Electricity Consumption in this room with 3 covered walls and 1 side sun exposed wall:7 units for 8 hours running in normal mode at 26*C3 units for 8 hours in 40% mode at 26*CFinally, I found buying big appliances from Amazon complete peace of mind and harassment free. The LG Ac is compact,  effective and very economic in terms of electricity consumption."
LC AC,"Very bad in installation, after 4 days of delivery still no once came for the installation"
LC AC,"Very Fast Delivery by Amazon as well Amazon supports Customers regarding installation. I have bought this AC in Great Indian Festival Offer. Product was Overall Nice. Need to Wait for sometime to Say its performance. Delivered in Just 2 days, Installation done by LG Service technician in same day. I m Happy. Thanks to Amazon."
LC AC,"Everything goes smoothly, I ordered on 29th March 2022 and Amazon delivered next day,  also i get the call for installation on the same day from LG but i installed it next day, the engineer visits for installation is a professional person he fixed everything in a professional way and very neat and cleanly, I am verry impressed from the service of Amazon and LG, now lets talk about the AC, This is really really amazing, specially its High Capacity mode is thrilling and you feel goosebumps within  5 minutes of Running at this mode, My Room area is 12 x 15 sq ft and on high capacity mode its getting chilled in 5 minutes, but i have no need to run on High capacity mode, mostly i run on 25 dirge 40% and i can say this is the best AC today in Indian market, if you really planning to buy a best AC, this is best choice for you, you never regret after brought this chilling machine....thanks and all the best guys.....about power consumption will write a review after 1 month usage."
LC AC,Really very nice experience with lg ac...Installation is very quick. I received product and get call for installation in just couple of hours.Installation guys are very polite.Really very happy with same day installation
LC AC,Just ok
LC AC,"If you want to save electricity than go for it,but if you want freezy kind of cooling this machine is not for you,it's struggling when you need quick cooling..i have 5 years old Daikin Inverter ac which is still much impressive and better cooling than lg"
LC AC,Best Product . No noise . Very nice cooling .. My room size is 14 x 14 but 1.5 ton chilled the room very fast .

LC AC,All is well but the remote settings is confusing.
LC AC,"Purchased this AC during the prevailing heat wave season. I have been using this for a week now and am pleasantly surprised on overall performance in terms of cooling and noise levels. Cannot comment on energy consumption yet, since it is too early."
LC AC,"As the name says Life's Good. LG's product are always value for money.Air conditioner is working good, floral design is new and unique.Installation service was also up to the mark within 48 hrs team came and installed it perfectly.Though it's been only 2 days since I'm using this product till now its value for money.Go for it. üëå"
LC AC,I am totally satisfied with the Ac performance.for me installation charges were 1499+324(drain pipe and other accessories) = 1743.Within 2 miniutes it cool down the room.
LC AC,Best colling machine energy‚ö° efficiency
LC AC,"I bought AC in April 22, but had the issue with compressor gas Twice already, disappointed due to this, it could be an installation issue or other, but this has definitely dampned the fun, AC when working works fine, very less nice level, effective cooling even at 40% compressor, 5 modes is very use full. Sleep mode is excellent. Except for gas issue no other problem, could be one off but still not expected for a brand like LG."
LC AC,"Airconditioner is practically silent, reallly good and efficient. installation was a pain and still not correct. still dealing with the inward water flow after 15days. So many core cutting holes made by the installation guys which have been incorrect places and now filled by shabby white cement . Installation is a horror & is negative star rating . AC is 5 star rating"
LC AC,"Copper pipe missing.Though Amazon will provide refund as they are already aware of it, but this is unnecessary task for customer to submit for refund and follow up. AC is good so far after a month usage. Be aware of installation charges for core drilling and extra pipe, wall mount bracket"
LC AC,The service agent was way more polite. Did service on time and made us understand in the most easiest way. Overall excellent service. Thanks LG
LC AC,"At installation time the service person asks for any arbitrary amount for mounting bracket, pipe, power plug, etc. Either LG should include these items in the box, or clearly mark the MRPs of these additional items, so that the customer does not have to haggle with the installation person."
LC AC,Its one of the LG‚Äôs top model and working in very good condition. There are no complaints on this as my relatives also purchased the same model or product
LC AC,The look and the performance. It cools very fast.
LC AC,Used ac in 4 in 1 mode and ran ac for 13-14 hrs a day @21degree for 30 days. Per day average consumption was 3-4 units only. Measured the same in smart switch also. Its pefect ac to buy
LC AC,"1. Saves electricity in 40% mode. This 6 in 1 feature is very good.2. Lg installation charges are very high. They'll force ar create a situation, that you have to buy extra copper pipe which will cost you around 1000 per meter."
LC AC,The product takes about 15-20 minutes to cool. The installation service provided by LG was horrible. It's the worst.
LC AC,LG has proved in Indian market with its reliability and performance and therefore I bought this lg ac. LG is a little bit pricey as compared to other products here but it's worth it to see yourself in longer run down 7 to 10 years hopefully.Also one more imp thing..... The copper wire and tube is not in the pack which manufacturer has to give and therefore the installation guy and buyer has to call Amazon and get that cost reimbursed and is a hassle.... Amazon did pay me back that money but in form of Amazon pay means you can shop with that money again on Amazon and cannot get in Bank.... Still alright as i keep shopping on Amazon
LC AC,"Good product to buy.I read many negative reviews regarding installation, but in my case, the installation was done the next day after the product delivery, The installation cost mentioned includes core drilling, and covering the hole with putty. Extra charges were for stand and water pipe which is reasonable. Rest I don't see any issues in the installation as I read in the reviews or it may vary from location to location or the Vendor approved by LG.It is only 2 days and product-wise it is great. The cooling is good. Noise is almost 0. We are using it at 28 or 26 temperatures and the cooling is awesome"
LC AC,It‚Äôs been more than 1 week I have used it and till now it‚Äôs amazing product
LC AC,good product
LC AC,Good product. Nice features
LC AC,
LC AC,Everything is ok as brand is LG but i m not happy with energy efficiency point if u buy a 5 star A LG AC but it's energy efficiency works as any other 3 star AC brand that's not justifying and not upto marks..  I purchased it 5 days before after using 3-4 days it getting 1.2 units per hour even in saving Modes.I uses 10-12 hours a day but still getting this consumption.Customer is paying a huge amount for brand name and it's energy efficiency claims.Correct me if wrong please.
LC AC,Good
LC AC,worthy for 37000/-
LC AC,LG quality is good but the service given by the LG people is not good.
LC AC,Good product and quick installation
LC AC,Very powerful and less noise more power perfect and suitable for home
LC AC,Till now working fine
LC AC,Good cooling and model
LC AC,I am writing review only after one day use. The AC unit is very very good. Its cooling is good. Noise level is little more what I expected but Ok. Remote is user friendly and size is good. Outdoor unit is mot making much noise as it is dual inverter AC unit.
LC AC,It was very good but missed copper pipe in order which is very bad impression and we can get money from Amazon but only fixed amount not full money which we spent for that and that money we can use only for amzon order in Amazon pay not a good sign
LC AC,As of now working fine
LC AC,Recommended to all for this deal. All the features are available.
LC AC,"The AC is great. Amazing cooling and very low noise. However, LG brand installation people charged us close to 11.5K for installation. Charged 1150/- per meter for copper wire. 3 meter copper wire missing. Very bad installation experience.  They overcharged us for everything and we ended up paying because if we get it done from outside, warranty cannot be claimed. Also, Amazon refunds for missing copper wire but at a flat rate of 750/- per meter."
LC AC,"Ac is good. Energy efficient. But Convertible feature is not good. Don't go for convertible AC. Convertible AC not cooling room, taking more energy.The remote of this AC do not have light on screen so using this on night is tough."
LC AC,Copper was missing in the box extra 6000/- ididnt get refund but ac performance is good
LC AC,Very nice AC this is running only 2 min chilled the room.
LC AC,purchased during sale at good discount.
LC AC,Excellent product
LC AC,"pros: 1 cooling awsome2. energy efficiency at 40%3. High capacity model is fast cooling room within minute but consume more unit per hour4. built quality is good5.remote quality also goodcons: 1 i am disappointed remote have not Display light2. swing blade not down full at under sitting the ac but doing manually is work, for not all time is dificult for up and down to adjustoverall cooling effective all mode work well"
LC AC,Service charge including tax = Rs. 1415Angular Outdoor stand for the outdoor unit + Gas pipe 10m = Rs. 885Liquid pipe 10m = Rs. 250Special Water proof sellotape for double wrap around (Rs. 400 for single wrap around) = Rs. 800Power plug = Rs. 100-150(purchased from electrician)Total = Rs. 3500 for complete installation service with installation kit and taxes
LC AC,"LG always bring good quality and innovation.This AC is also packed with same. Good performance so far and very fresh piece I have received. Very intact packaging and smooth operation so far. LG team was also very nice and they have installed it very nicely. Just within 16 hrs after delivery,  the AC was installed. We are thankful to Amazon and LG for very quick response."
LC AC,
LC AC,Good cooling but makes a strange hissing sound sometimes
LC AC,Recommended to buy. Worth product
LC AC,"1) In box missing of copper wire, but amazon with LG resolution was Amazing in quick time resolution.2) AC was too good & very fast cooling.3) Silent AC4) Good features5) Price worthable for this good product"
LC AC,I received 2021 model instead of 2022. Otherwise LG AC is good...its cooling is awesome.
LC AC,"It's been about a month I'm using it. The best part is, u can operate it using lesser power if ur room is smaller. Till now no complaints. Would have been happier if I have got glow buttons in remote along with its case. All in all a 4 star it deserve."
LC AC,"Nice product. Worth buying,"
LC AC,Still dnt know about Energy efficiency. Noise level is very less and  sleep mode also good
LC AC,Very good cooling and silent
LC AC,
LC AC,LG installation services are very very bad. Do not installed AC from LG technician.
LC AC,"It's excellent, cools entire room within 5 mins in normal AC mode. Done the same within 2 mins in HC mode. Saves energy alot.. cons: installation.. lots of hidden charges.. they mentioned in description 1400+.. but we have to pay 3k to 5k even you have existing AC stand.. Wall hole.. stabilizer etc ."

LC AC,Nice
LC AC,"Leakage issue stop after one month. I contract service center they told we don't have part ,ie from one month my new ac not working."
LC AC,This product is very good.But noise issue.
LC AC,Really bang for a buck. Great looks and performs well. Plus it comes with all wires and casings inside. Technicians were great too and they just came with their tools required for drilling etc. Really impressed with LG and planning to replace my Daikin with LG later. Long term performance however remains to be assessed
LC AC,Product is nice...I am from Tirupati.I have read many negative reviews on lg customer service.It is totally false.I got call within 2 hours and they installed on the same day.They charged 1415/-installation charge per ac.The persons ANIL and IRFAN who installed very nicely and there behaviour was also very polite.Don‚Äôt think about customer service of LG.They are providing the best.This is a genuine review.once again thanks to ANIL and IRFAN üòäüòäüòä.  One thing I forgot to say I bought two ac‚Äôs.I didn‚Äôt get copper pipe for both.AMAZON should take care of it.Thank you.
LC AC,"The cooling is absolute standout. Been using Voltas for a while. But this stands out in terms of modes, cooling and energy efficiency."
LC AC,lg ke service quick mil jati hai...
LC AC,"Responsive and good product. Not happy with serviceWhile buying, keep in mind that you will have to pay min 6000 extra to installation people.(all service providers are same - cheater LG, whirlpool, Onida ...)"

LC AC,"Hi team, the service person who came for fitting, has not done his job properly. When we are starting the AC,water is leaking and room is filled with water. Lot of water is leaking. Pls do the needful. Send the service person again for recheck"
LC AC,The product was good but we didn‚Äôt get copper wires in the package and when technician visited for the installation he has collected 3360 for copper wires and said that it will be refunded . Unnecessarily waste of money and time by calling to Amazon repeatedly. I suggest you Not to  buy in the online as the package was incomplete. Better prefer offline purchasing
LC AC,Go for it. It‚Äôs the best
LC AC,I have been using This AC since last month and I would say it is best AC in this prize range. Cooling is awesome. My room size is 15*12 and it cools my room within 10-15 mins only.Must buy product

LC AC,I have done lot of research before purchasing this. Really happy with the purchase even though it is little more costly.The noise level is very less. I can also see the freshness in the room because of the dehumidifier and anti bacterial functionality.It is correctly maintaining the temperature without cooling too much.Installation happened on the third day. Fortunately in Hyderabad the installation team has done a good job and were professional.Thank you.

LC AC,This is our first AC. writing this review after using it for 2 months. It is power efficient. It has both horizontal and vertical swing which is cooling the room a bit fast when compared with other ACs.Installation was done on the day of receiving the product.Overall I'm happy for purchasing this product.Thank you LG and Amazon.

LC AC,If you are buying an ac then it should be LG

LC AC,Totally hassle free purchase and hassle free installation. Go for it . Remember you gotta pay like 2700 for installation
LC AC,"Product is excellent, Amazon delivery also made it memorable, but disappointing was agency handling installation process‚Ä¶ Absolutely disgusting the way they behave ..Otherwise satisfactory"
LC AC,"Fantastic air conditioner. Chills the room in a jiffy. The 6-in-1 mode is great. You could operate in 80%, 60% and 40% modes depending on the need which consumes much lesser power. One gripe is Inhad to pay extra 4k for installation charges, corecutting and outdoor unit brackets. LG should give atleast the brackets in the box"
LC AC,I have purchased this AC 15 days back. The MRP shown on amazon is Rs. 75990/- but actual MRP on Box is Rs. 52000/-. Also no where is mentioned about 5 years warranty on PCB. This AC does not support to ThinQ application as it does not connect to WiFi.
LC AC,"Please never buy any LG products. The Customer Service is worst to the core.. During package they missed a part. So these technician demand we need bare the amount for it.. it cost around 4.5k then then dont terrible service and ask 8k for service.. So i bought 45k AC and spend additional 12k, still i am not happy with service leakage/Low cooling/Gas Leakage keeps happening"
LC AC,I would summeries in this way.Pros-1. Looks fantastic2. Cooling is excellent.3. Efficient in power saving.4. Service is good.5. Feature rich.Cons:-1. Not particularly a con but initial price is a bit expensive.2. Installation cost is high if you require extra copper pipe for your outdoor unit.3. No wifi or connected features even at this price.Overall good experience.
LC AC,Product is great. Performance is upto the mark. No doubt why this is the best selling AC in India right now.
LC AC,I was in doubt when I read some comments that they didn't received copper pipes but still I found this ac best so I ordered this. After ordering I got next day delivery and got installation on same day of delivery. Also I got all accessories including 10 feet copper pipes. Working really smooth low noise and super cooling.
LC AC,Lg is superb as always
LC AC,"Inappropriate information about the product.Its clearly mentioned that Ac installation is added and price is 0.But we have to separately pay for installation price 1500 , so don‚Äôt play with words and misguide customers."
LC AC,"Its really good AC , energy efficient. I used it regularly in night even few times in day also my monthly consumption of AC is 1600."
LC AC,It's a good AC but I am not sure it's energy efficient because I am charged than expected.. Overall I am satisfied with this brand.
LC AC,AC Performance with 6 In 1 Function is really good
LC AC,Does its work nicely. Noise it doest disturb and its very low.

LC AC,
LC AC,What a fast delivery ..it got delivered 2days early in the morning. The packaging is good. Got the call from LG service center immediately and the LG service guy called in next few minutes ... Got installation by afternoon. Service guy charged 2500. 1500 for standard installation charges and 1000 for Stand...A big kudos to LG team
LC AC,"It is the best AC, I recommend to all,Only remote stand was missing in AC package, later on i have notice when i seen it manual else it was packed very well and timely delivered by Amazon."
LC AC,Good function build in this ac. i hope same will continue in the future as well.Ai mode and convertible are more energy efficient.
LC AC,I love this product
LC AC,"No issues with the product,but when comes to installation part their are many hidden charges. They charge out door installation charge ‚Çπ300 since I have my own outdoor stand, masking of tape on copper wire ‚Çπ200 and as usual they take ‚Çπ1,415 for installation."
LC AC,Just ok
LC AC,Power consumption is still bit issue

¬†The video is clear proof of low quality LG products in 2022.LG has degraded quality of products over time. The second we switched on the unit, and the compressor started, there was a loud noise from the compressor.It took us 10 days to get the complaint raised, and escalated. On day they said, no sir, this is regular noise.1. They we not accepting the quality issue, and trying pass on the product as it is.2. They suggested to move the unit to roof, since its behind the room wall noise is coming -> and thinking I will be accepting bad quality product.It took a lot of my effort and calls, but they were not willing to completely replace the product.At the end, they offered to replace the compressor, but why would I get repairs done in a brand new product ?Why did the company not test it thoroughly, and till the breaking point, before even makreting the product ? LG has to answer these question.All thanks to amazon, that only through them, we were able to return the product and  Amazon maintained the trust it has always showed. LG had done no effort at all."
LC AC,Excellent üëç
LC AC,Best AC with zero noice both in indoor and outdoor unit. Fast cooling and Himalaya cool mode is excellent.Little bit pricy but quality comes with a cost. Using for a week now so energy efficiency have not been checked yet.
LC AC,It‚Äôs completely different charges installation added with zero but when technician came from LG they asking 1500Rs although its included with AC. Completely opposite from description mentioned over here
LC AC,"I am giving this review after a week.This product is really good. Worth for money. Noiseless products while using thisOn high capacity. 6-1 features are really good. Sleeping mode, timer features are good. I can say this ac is best.Thanks LG"
LC AC,"This is the Best AC for Energy Savings I have Used this From 11:00 PM To 05:00 AM and This Only Used 4 Readings including My Fridge, Lights and Fan. If We Calculate then 4√ó7Rs per Reading is equal to 35 Rs Per Day and Total One Month is 35√ó30=Rs-1050....!!!!"

¬†In Sambalpur Odisha I installed this LG AC but they take charges (1500+1100)‚Ä¶.Standard charge 1500 + 1100 for stand and 3pin plug, White cement paste fittings‚Ä¶I think they taken  extra 400 for the stand but overall I can say low cost paid when compared with other reviews like 4000/5000 rupees"
LC AC,Good product
LC AC,
LC AC,„ÄãThe best ac in its class.„ÄãBest & professional installation (you should know how to make ppl work by telling them upfront that we'll pay extra over standard installation charges if every thing done at optimum level).
LC AC,AC fan not working & AC is not functioning at all
LC AC,LG air conditioner delivers what it promises. Powerful cooling and noise free outdoor unit.  Its beats top floor heat and cools room immediately on High cooling mode. LG installation team was professional. Thanks amazon for delivering the production super fast and safe.
LC AC,Excellent üëåüëåüëå
LC AC,"Product wise its a best in the market. But installation is handled by third party vendors, which give some negative impression. Money minded vendor, billing for the kits which come with product."
LC AC,"Very bad. Lg shows it will take 800 units in a year but I face that it is taking 200 units in 60 hrs of running, even the temperature always took 20/20+"
LC AC,I gave a negative feedback earlier due to some kavi of knowledge because the installation team never told me about how frequently the filter needs cleaning.Now my AC is working perfect.The filter needs to be cleaned every fortnight
LC AC,You buy from anywhere you have to pay the Installation so there is nothing like cheating.Delivered second day and with in 2 hours of delivery Installation has been done by LG.Quick and prompt service from LG and Amazon.Further i will update review after usage of AC for few days.
LC AC,I am very much satisfied with this product. It was delivered on time and goy installed same day. I didn't face any kind of issue. The engineer who installed was very professional and did a very good job.
LC AC,Overall good
LC AC,Look is very Nice.  Indore Noice is high. Air flow through is very low. Main problem is Swing is not coming down properly. Swing moves only little ahgle. Hence cooling is not reachable property. I didn't expect this from LG
LC AC,"Instant cooling not in this ac, approx 30 min take in cooling, wrost product.I recived my 1.5 ton Ac on  14 April 22, company services engineer visited but, they are very unprofessional, they don't have equipment for drill in wall, they told me they can't install ac, so I call technicians from out side, when he open box interconnecting Copper  pipe missing, I call Amazon they rejected tosend missing part, I faced very poor experience  with buy ac from Amazon.After 6 month use, I can say totly worst product, I will never take lg product."

LC AC,The performance is best available in now 2022 market models . But I do use 2020 model of LG and that is better than this one . Rest its upto the customer what they want
LC AC,"AVOID LG - They have UNPROFESSIONAL technical partners (RAR Enterprises).For first couple of days the AC appears to be working as expected, though nothing special to mention.Pros:1. On time delivery.2. Installation was done on same day of delivery.3. Tech Support team did the follow-ups till installation payment.4. Technician agreed to change the installation wall after a messy installation on first wall.Cons:1. One of the worst installation experience,2. Technician-cum-engineer was in hurry and was not completing the job in neat way,3. Technician did not properly cover the copper pipes with insulation, and gave vague excuses evertime,4. Technician did not had proper tools, he used the drill bit that made mess out of the wall hole,5. Very bad and uneven fitting of base plate of indoor unit, used hammer instead of screw-driver that messed few screws and he kept those as it is under the plate making it uneven.6. Bottom cover of AC is not straight due to bad fixing of base plate.7. Charged hefty amount of 5k for additional items without providing any invoice, even support team did not share the online copy of invoice as informed on call beforehand.8. Technician did not perform amphere test,9. Improper fitting of the wires in both indoor and outdoor unit, after confrontting replied with vague excuses."

LC AC,I like the HC mode cooling very fast.
LC AC,"Good cooling, cooling on 28* also"
LC AC,"The installation process is a nightmare. You are forced to get it installed only by their technicians, who are unprofessional and are only looking for creative ways to make additional money off the installation. Reaching out to the customer care helpline is equally frustrating and futile. Most of the reviews across India complain about the installation process but we were hoping we would be an exception to the horrible experience. Unfortunately not. Please reconsider buying LG for this reason. Keep in mind that your actual budget for the AC depends on your luck, of which technician is assigned to you and this will be an uncertain risk even after you purchase the AC."

LC AC,Nice product from Amazon
LC AC,I purchased LG split AC from amazon at June 2022. The AC installed at end of June 2022. The AC total working time is less that 2 days.The AC is been reporting multiple issues day one onwards. The service engineer replaced sensor but the issues repeated. He has tried to replace the main board last week but the board not matching with the my model. During the time I have observed that the new AC come with refurbished board (Board has Multiple pen mark and no standard labels.) the board pic is attached with this. (Please explain why the new AC come with this type of board?)I hereby kindly request to replace the entire AC (Indoor and outdoor unit) or refund the amount.

LC AC,"This product shipped from Amazon don‚Äôt have copper wire. On calling Amazon customer care, executive rejected request to reimburse the copper pipe expense which was missing and at my surprise advised to return or replace.Product is good otherwise."
LC AC,Really worth product
LC AC,"First of all, it failed to do what it was supposed to do i.e cool the room down. The cooling effect wasn't enough. Secondly, it became an exhaust pipe inside the room! 4 days of cooling insufficiently, the AC became a bane in my life slowly starting to turn things black. On the 5th after installation, I took my dog for a walk, 20 min later I walked into a room that was visibly covered in black smoke, you could see it in the air. Everything in the room turned black including the unit itself, my wife and I coughed out black phlegm  for 2 days! Thank God for Amazon, it was under 10 day return window, returned it and replaced it with panasonic! They charged 6k for installation, I paid an additional 3k for Uninstaller and installing the new AC, total 9k in the hole, but it was worth it to replace it with the panasonic."
LC AC,"Good buy, but expensive."

LC AC,The after sales service of LG is really bad. The installation was done properly. The AC is not cooling at all. If a ac is not installed properly and the copper pipes aren't vaccumed then the cooling won't be proper and the technician outright refuse to vaccum the pipes saying it is unnecessary. Don't buy this product. You may regret it.

LC AC,Product is good but did a mistake buying through Amazon. They are not sending copper wire in the outdoor box unit and during installation we need to suffer with high prices from service providers .. and of course we will have to contact  Amazon for the refund of missing copper wire (up to 3 meters)and then we will get the refund( but you will end up getting less refund back than what actually you paid to service provider during installation) back to Amazon pay balance and not to your original source of payment. It‚Äôs a BIG non sense.

LC AC,This is the purchase I ever done. Pack didn‚Äôt include 10ft copper pipe which costs around 3000rs. As my site wasn‚Äôt ready I couldn‚Äôt install and detected late so amzn didn‚Äôt get agree to replace or bear the cost of the pipe. I installed it by paying that 10ft pipe gas seems to be very low that AC can‚Äôt even produce what cooler produce. I am regretting a lot for this purchase.

Today is fourth day after delivery, despite contacting amazon, LG service Centre multiple times , no installation date is given till now, passing the pillow game is being played between amazon , LG toll free service and local service centre, everybody providing local service centre number, which nobody picks up üôèüèª3. Will revise review and write about product working , if it is installed4. Buy this product if u are ok with waiting long to use the AC"
LC AC,My ac is not cooling..... worst product by LG .Amazon also doesn't give a window to raise any issue for that. The technician also not able to find the defect.....total loss of 45k. People be careful.....think twice before you buy......Ac failure in just 10 days of purchase......Amazon is fooling people with duplicate product and mentioning it as best seller.

I haven't got solution from Amazon except return and refund(no replacement available for me). I am trying to resolve it via LG support with part replacement covering under product warenty.I hope they can help me here.Edit: I contacted LG support who sent the installation person to me, they helped in replacing the part and today they replaced that part for free. Now AC looks perfect and cooling also good after using it for almost 3 weeks. I just keep it in 24 and 60% which is more than enough."

The installation was also not properly done. Planning to change again. Waste of Money, Energy, and Time. Maybe a defective or previously returned product. No response from anyone"
LC AC,LG selling defected ACs..I bought it in April 2022 and after a month CH 41 error start coming intermittently.LG engineer even don't know what is this error.After this error AC stops and then we have to restart manually.Looks LG selling defected product without any quality check.So it is my advise to other who want to buy LG product.Don't go for LG product and this costly AC.
LC AC,Outdoor unit not working.dispointed
LC AC,"I like the product, but as default copper pipe is missing. Worst part is, due to high prices copper pipe is coming for 1k per metre outside and amazon is saying it can give only 750rs per metre and cant pay gst either. You will need to bear 800 rs for missing copper wire even after amazon claim. Pure Daylight robbery, buy only if you are okay with this."
LC AC,Customer service is very verry poor of LG....First of all no one came here for installation....After so many call they came and installed....But they did not properly installed... Started water leakage issue.... Almost 15 days has been past but they did not came to check the AC....This is brand....When I call to LG team they answer your solution will be resolved within 24 hrs.... Service is Zero Zero Zero

I called LG customer care service but the service engineer said that this was not abnormal. they said that they cannot solve this problem. very poor service response from LG care. So please do not buy this LG Product. Just go for Samsung AC.

LC AC,I have brought this AC 15 days ago and now its stop working . I have made a complaint to LG India 3 days ago and no one has called or visit my place till now. This product is totally money waste . Please dont buy
LC AC,"Though the ac is good enough, copper wire wasn‚Äôt provided along with the order and had to pay an extra 3363 along with installation charges. Getting a reimbursement is a big hassle to avoid all this, consider another product or during the installation itself ask if copper wire or if every parts are available if they say no.. just return it don‚Äôt pay extra."
LC AC,AC not working after 3rd day of ac installation
LC AC,I bought the product and when the installation person's came and opened the box the copper wire was not there. I had to pay on my own to buy that copper wire. I don't know if Amazon or LG is the fault here but I am asking for a refund of the money that I paid for the copper wire.

¬†Copper wire missing"
LC AC,"lG'S new AC in 2022 is just great . It comes with Dual invertor split which will save you a lot of electricity bill.This is a 2022 model so everything is latest and will gives you the best chill in the room at the earliest .Ac is silent when running which is always positive.Just check with the vendor for installation as many have said its not free and they are charging , better call LG and ask."
LC AC,"This LG ac product has PCB complaint.. I just used very minimum but got issue with outdoor PCB , and service charge for replacement was Rs 6000 /-. So, pls check about or ask about PCB warranty also. lG has experienced with so many pcb related complaint while checking other customers reviews.. Its very bad and kind of fraud"
LC AC,"I bought two LG ACs .One went faulty with in 8 months , they had to replace  Blower motor and oscilator wire.The other showed  an error ""Lo"" and they took it for testingWhen the returned it , they charged me more than Rs. 12000/  for transport , gas charging , copper tube etcAfter about 8 months , it went faulty again !This time the technician says i will have to pay Rs.10000/-  because he 'suspects' the  condensor is faulty !I have never  ever heard  such a remark from any service engineer till now !So be very cautious , about buying an LG AC"

¬†Modal :- LG PS-Q19CNZE (2022 latest model)Price :- 43900 ( offshow room)Purchased Date :- 23/12/2022Reveiw Date :- 25/12/2022Room Size :- 11 feet √ó 10 feetLG's fan system is useless for users who sitting or lying down. Importantly, even if you put it on level one, the fan of the AC does not blow downwards, it comes up to half the way, and if you want the air of the AC to blow on the body, you have to stand atleast distance of 11 feet. Otherwise the flap has to be adjusted down each time eventually it may causes the AC to become compliant. This is not only for this model but for all LG models.when the technician was called. They said it's is the normal level of LG and we can't do nothing."
LC AC,"This ac is marketed agressively ,but seems like it's deceiving . I paid almost 50000 for the wifi model but cooling isnot at all effective. I feel bad as it costed me so much ,me being a middle class person . Room heats up instantly after switching off the ac . Please don't waste your money . Bad product ."
LC AC,"This AC is not working as it was advertised. I have second ac of voltas with same spec and it's far better. Cooling effect is not there at all. With voltas cooling happens in 30 min and same lg takes 2 hours and it has to run continuously. Installation was too complicated, I spend 15k as service man told he can only fix attachment on top floor. Same case was not with voltas. Inverter is in built, but still I had to purchase stabilizer as recommended strongly by lg person. I am totally dis satisfied with this product. And it was a one time purchase for me, means I have to live my complete life with this stuff now."
LC AC,"Serious warning ‚ö†Ô∏è don't even think about buying this ac , i would say lg is the worst brand in terms of ac , the their service is pathetic too , It stopped colling within a month . And filed multiple complaints , they come and service the ac then go , again the same problem continues , if you still wish to buy , good luck is all i can say"

¬†Awesome product go ahead ver good product take care while installing ac nice product from lg best ac love it"
LC AC,"This review is for the service rather than the product. Checked the price here and at an electronic store, it was available for 3K less at the store. So bought it. The basic installation costs Rs.1415/-, which is standard I guess. But too much for us, because the outdoor unit can be placed right behind the room in the Balcony. And the technician couldn't do the basic connection with the wire for power. Had to call Electrician for that, he just joined the wire and charged 300 bucks :/. And the way of installation was not professional at all as they promote. They left all the packaging as it is, the sand and cement from drilling and plastering around the pipe has not been done. Why the hell do they charge so much the work isn't worth that much. The LG service is way too bad. All show and promotion about service, but nothing much in reality. The products are good, but without proper service there's no use of buying expensive electronics."
LC AC,Such products should never be bought online. I got the product from Croma store. Everything was told like for what I will have to pay extra and all these things. The installation was perfectly done.

LC AC,Fantastic product i liked it very much the product is excellent. I liked the product and hence wanted to give it 5 star.
LC AC,"It's been just one year since i bought this dual inverter AC from LG in showroom nearby.From one year , i faced like 6-7 times motor problems, Code errors... Also my room is quiet small only. This 1.5 ton ac doesn't bring any cooling to the room even when it cools like 2-3 hours..  i complaind multiple times.. they changed the coil & motor in warranty. Nothing works.. lg customer care team simple saying that this ac got low output only.. god damn i bought this ac for like 40k.Recommended not to buy AC from brand like lg"
LC AC,Good üëç and energy efficiency is good and artificial intelligence in ac is available and 6 in 1 is available in that ac
LC AC,It is very disheartening to know that such a reputed brand does not have employees to properly install the AC . They don't have an instrument to drill a round hole in the wall. They will use a hammer and chisel to make the hole and wreak havoc with your decorated and painted walls . And for this disservice they will charge you heavily. ludicrous . This experience is from Amritsar city.
LC AC,Excellent performance. Cools with in seconds. Almost silent operation. Higly recommends this product to all.Remote control is also very easy to use
LC AC,"So spend around 10k for copper pipes for around 9 feet of pipes ans around 4k for installation . They didn't provide any copper pipes. All ac sellers provide atleast 2 feet of piping, and more over the cost per sq ft of ac pipe is 1100 per  sqft.. Simply amazed at the daylight robbery.. LG needs to be ashamed"
LC AC,"I purchased this AC 3 years before... Now cooling of this AC is totally ineffective. I have checked my Gas, Jet cleaned all the filters, still it can't cool my room below 27 degree after running of 6 hours...when I asked the technician they only said one thing..."" THIS IS A FAILURE PRODUCT OF LG""."
LC AC,"Cooling issues.Rusted after 2 year even my outdoor unit is not exposed to sun and rain.Poor fan design, dust easily accumulate to fan and you will feel drop in air throw.LG ac has only features not good cooling. Better buy voltas,onida,diakin,carrier,hitachi if you need ac."
LC AC,"Worst service of company , Just  Waste of moneyand  useless product , no cooling .Never believe on these  LG productsAfter using 2years L.g. are fully eligible to throw .After service is very bad...Never expected this from LG products"
LC AC,No colling. Very low cooling is done by the AC.. very bad experience had hope from lG.. not good productMost Horrible AC!! Do not but LG horrible cooling!! Does bot cool at all and requires cleaning every few days..
LC AC,"One of the worst ac ompany in the world.Technician also can't find the problem , the person who is working as a technician can't find the problem , please don't go through the LG electronic items , bad quality. Bad service"
LC AC,"I had a free installation, but the local service center charged more than Rs 2715/- out of which Rs 1415/- is installation charge.Either the AC is defective or it is not installed properly. So the cooling time is late."
LC AC,"Hi People,Before buying the product please look into the feedback in below of the product.Once I booked in Amazon it got delivered in 10 days and for connection I got a multiple cas from the various services center's and they suggest to the change the stabilizer because i booked in online when I book the ac  and they forced me to return the stabilizer and forced to Take there stabilizer from dealer.. atlast i not aggred. so they are not aggred to provide the service to fix the ac . And later one hour I got a another call abd they agreed to give the connection but at last.. for ac the water should go outside but this bad service people given the wrong connection which the water is coming inside..where u can the picture attached.. and once I called to service people they are reacting very badly and they're not at a all a concern people.. and after giving connection we are not the people to contact again..And main thing is outside box i clearly explained in the call which it has to be fixed on slab.. but they given for the wall with forcing.. unfortunately that time I am not in home and they tried to forced my parents to have it on wall for this they charged extra 700 which i not received a bill and.. for the service 1500 also i not received bill ... Once I had problem. Giving the Power connection to the ac i found the problem and they're are not reacting this blady worst service from the lg service provided üôèüôèüôè"
LC AC,"I have been using this from last summer. Initially every thing is good, but from last two months very much noise from machine and swing machanism not working....remote not connecting to AC.. finally not good brand...."

¬†It's a manufacturing defact, no one resolve this problem, please read google reviews fist maximum temp 27¬∞.third class ac.......... ,.,.."
LC AC,The AC units are excellent. Great deal and prompt delivery in very good condition by Amazon. Installation by LG personnel was excellent. My two units are working fantastic with nearly no noise and overall very satisfying.
LC AC,Great product... It's artificial intelligence ensure the cooling is maintained inside the room. Power consumption has been very very low. This is the fourth dual inverter AC which I have purchased for my residence
LC AC,Consumes just 4 units of power for usage from 8pm to 7am at 26deg c. Initially consumes 1850 Watts for about 10 minutes and then for most of the time consumes around 350 Watts only.
LC AC,This is the best ac you can buy. Lg provides good customer service and the product is also very good. Probably best AC out there lot of energy saving features .
LC AC,I really liked the product and appreciate the quick delivery. The overall installation process was hassle free and i received complete support as expected.
LC AC,"Copper wire is missing from my order, LG you have such a good brand name...but still you are doing this kind of cheap cost saving....@amazon you are promoting this .....not a good thing ...."

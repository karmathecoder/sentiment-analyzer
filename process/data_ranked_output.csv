Powerful cooling even with normal mode. I'm using it for 250 soft hall with doors to 3 rooms.2. It has four normal modes where AC runs at 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% capacity to reach the same temperature and can be used in conjunction with the density of crows and heat generating systems inside the room whereas a high capacity mode (6 in 1_H'Capa button on remote which runs at 110% capacity and extra speed of indoor unit for faster cooling runs only for 90 mins). This setting has a dedicated button on the remote.4. Then, we have an AI mode that senses the load and runs at optical capacity (6 in 1_AC+4 button on remote)5. Fins on both units have what they call ocean black coating to enhance the life of the fins by providing protection against external elements Indoor unit sound is on the lower side. The outdoor unit is a bit loud but its an outdoor one.7. Large display which you can switch off especially at night)8. You may use it simply to create an inflow inside the room without a cooling effect9. It has a dehumidifier mode to reduce humidity inside simply10. Since this one is an ISEER 5 star device (818 units per year under test conditions it consumes fairly less electricity but dont expect wonders11. It has a hidden power on/off button located below the horizontal vane, on the right side, for use in case of emergencies12. Sleep mode is a nice option as at a set temperature you tend to start feeling cold after some time, and this mode increases temperature by 2 degrees over the next hour.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚ûñ OBSERVATIONS & CONS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢The only cons are in the remote and not the unit:1.

It comes with a leaflet having installation instructions along with a user manual Please GO through it and ask them to follow the guideline such as the indoor unit is installed at a slight inclination rather than being completely horizontal for smooth flow of water that collects on the tray over time of operation2. Leakage are to be checked using soap water at all the joints Power supply and all also need to be checked and generally this step is skipped When the engineer calls before visiting ask them to bring a core drill to avoid using a hammer and chisel which damages the wall, and the hole is also not uniform.5. Carefully plan the position of the hole on the wall so that the wire, drain pipe, and copper pipes can directly go to the opposite side of the wall and can be hidden behind the unit.6. The hole should not be straight but have an inclination of a few degrees toward the outside.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üîÅ FEATURES‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. All of the features are accessible via remote and the main unit has only one button to switch the unit on/off, and that too is buried deep inside Comfort air mode tongues between the top and bottom positions of the horizontal flap. So, if suddenly you need to turn the inflow toward the ceiling away from you, this is the button.

Mode to tongue between cool dry and dehumidification modes5. 6 in 1 H'Capa and 6 in 1 AC + 4, to switch between 4 capacities (100%, 80%, 60%, 40%), AI mode, and High capacity mode6. Horizontal and vertical swings can be combined for many positions to direct air anywhere in the room It can be towards the top right corner, bottom left corner, center, left or right half of the room etc.7. Room temperature tells the current room temperature via a sensor installed in the remote so its like the remote's temperature which should be the same as room temperature )8. Sleep button - sleep function is an exciting bit where you can set 1 hour to 7 hours timer, and additional system increases the temperature in increments of 1 every 30 mins two times in any cycle for comfortable sleep9.

AC copper pipe is available on Amazon at Rs. 200 per meter and copper pipe insulation foam is a available on Amazon for Rs. 100 per meter. So total cost on Amazon is Rs. 300 per meter. Just way too expensive pricing by installation team for copper pipe. They charged me Rs. 4500 for 4.5 meter pipe and Rs. 7046 overall for installation Don't know if this is standard rate of copper pipe from LG or if the local installed is overcharging.

LC AC,Putting this review After usage of more than 2 months Overall ac performance is nice specially noise level is amazingly lowest does it job decentlySome of the features which are missed after being so high on price:1. no temperature control when ac is run on moisture mode.2. Since it is convertible and and has AI mode also it becomes confusing to operate.3. Remote control unit does not have screen backlight display which is a big miss.4. AI mode should be customisable as per users requirementsOverall four stars for this ac.Installation and pipe charges are extra which may cost around 2100/-.,0.4679611650485437

LC AC,"This is a review after only a week of installation Will update the review after prolonged usage.DeliveryThe Amazon delivery is hassle free as usual AC was delivered within promised date. A point to note here is that Amazon does not provide the stand for external unit. It has to be procured through service personnel at additional cost. Overall delivery experience 5/5.InstallationThe installation ticket was raised by Amazon as soon as the AC was delivered LG customer care contracted me the same day and arranged installation for the very next day. The technicians were clueful and courteous The only hiccup I faced was with making a hole for pipelines and power cable for outer unit from inner unit. Since the wall was thick and considerably wet on the outside due to going rains a procedure called core cutting was resorted to This work is not done by the LG technicians but they were helpful enough to suggest a local guy for the same The cost was told front and no I faced no issues with the work done The installation process continued and was completed the same day with no further problems The installation is charitable and not included in the order. Overall 4/5.PerformanceThe performance of the AC is exemplary There are multiple modes in the AC for different power saving setups depending on the environmental conditions and people inside the room These can be selected manually or through automatic AI mode. The AI mode (dislayed as AC on the unit) is where this AC truly shines It automatically senses the conditions and sets the compressor and fan speed to opium levels During the use of this mode, the AC was able to maintain comfortable and opium temperature throughout the night without any intervention from us. I was more than happy to see its performance after a good nights sleep. The AC also has a High Cool function for those cruel summer afternoon where the performance is ramped up above its nominal limits but for a limit amount of time (90 mins). This is for quickly cooling the room during hot days There are other features like silent mode, ionisation mode etc which can be accessed through function button kn the remote The remote does not come with a backlight or night glow buttons but that didn cause a problem as the AI mode was competent enough to keep me comfortable without any intervention from my side. Overall the performance is 5/5.",0.21165048543689322
